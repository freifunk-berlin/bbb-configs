# Contributing to Falter
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use GitHub, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Test your code by making a ansible run building the configs
3. Make sure your code lints (it has correct syntax).
4. Make sure that every commit in your PR matches the formal requirements (see below).
5. Issue that pull request!

### Requirements on commits
Please make sure, that every commit you make to this repository meets this requirements. We rebase and merge this commits on top of the main branch.

Commit messages should contain enough information to understand your change. The should follow this pattern:

```
$LOCATION: $DESCRIPTION
```

For other changes you might use the category of your change like `docs` or `treewide` instead of `$LOCATION`.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPLv3 Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPLv3 License](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/falter-packages/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/bbb-configs/issues/new); it's that easy! For problems regarding the hardware at the location open an Issue at the [meta repository](https://github.com/freifunk-berlin/meta/issues/new).

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
A good bug report helps the maintainers a lot to understand you problem and fix it faster.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.
